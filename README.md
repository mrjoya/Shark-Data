# Sorting shark data
Sorting a text file with Shark data in Java

This assignment was part of my course module CSD2221 - Software Development and Projects.
The assignment consisted of a single shark-data.txt file with a bunch of data on each line.
The task was to parse this file and extract the data from it and do a number of different things, 
such as displaying the three largest sharks by length, Total number of unique latin words and so on.

This project was developed using Java and Netbeans.
